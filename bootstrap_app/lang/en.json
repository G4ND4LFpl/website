        "It is a variation of the known universe <a href=\"https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Warhammer_40k_Wiki\" class=\"linkstyle\" target=\"_blank\">Warhammer 40k</a>. Some aspects have been changed in it, but it retains the climate of its original.",
        "The main aspect of this universe is humanity, which is trying to fight for its place in a dangerous galaxy full of demons, sinister aliens and ancient technologies. However, unlike Warhammer 40k, the Emperor does not lead humanity and is merely a past of previous millennium, and his orders of space marines are the last remaining symbols of his vision. However, now humanity is led by a corrupt republic in which numerous factions have internal disputes over influence."
